# Summary

UWGeo is a high-level python interface to the Underworld API. 
It provides a suitable framework for rapidly prototyping mechanical and 
thermo-mechanical numerical models both in 2D and 3D.

UWGeo functionalities include:

* Handle units through the pint package.
* Semi-automatic scaling through the definition of characteristic variables.
* Function to define 2D and 3D shapes from simple boxes to more complex composite shapes.
* Lithostatic pressure calculation
* Isostasy module.
* Partial melt calculation and the associated change(s) in viscosity / heat production.
* Viscous, Visco-plastic, Visco-elasto-plastic rheologies implementation.
* Database of common rheologies used in Geodynamics.
* Possibility to import personal rheology databases.
* von Mises, Coulomb and Drucker-Prager yield criterions.
* Phase changes
* Frictional boundary condition
* Indentor definition
* Simple Adaptive mesh

UWGeo comes with a series of examples and tutorials such as:

* Simple
